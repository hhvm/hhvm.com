HHVM 4.153 is released! This release marks the end of support of 4.146; 4.147 -
4.151 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases. HHVM 4.152 was
skipped due to issues with the nightly builds.

# Highlights

- Added function/method name to error messages.
- Added `\HH\Lib\OS\posix_spawnp` and `\HH\Lib\OS\posix_spawn`, which supports a
  subset functionality of the corresponding POSIX C API.
- Added `getopt_with_optind` native function to support simple subparsers.
- Added a quickfix for nonexistent type name in params
# Breaking Changes

- Fix unsoundness with closure properties in readonly check. For example
  `($this->f)()` now requires readonly check if the return type of `f` is
  readonly.
- Fix missing Set key type bound. `(Set {})->add($non_arraykey)` now properly
  raises a type error.
