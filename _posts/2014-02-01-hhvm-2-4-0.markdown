    Great news!
    Do you have a live document that shows framework compatibility? If not, it would be great to have a link somewhere here, showing how each framework is doing during each release.

    I just installed it today and was wondering why I got the 2.4 version as, from what I knew, the latest version is 2.3. It's nice when things work out :) .

    Awesome job, guys, as always.

    to get the new version.  So, technically I got hhvm 2.4 before the rest of the
    world knew about it.  Booyah!

  content: Good question. We didn't really focus on performance this release since
    it included the holidays and many people were out of the office. I know each internal
    release was in the single digit %s so I wouldn't expect anything too large. If
    others want to measure, that would be useful.

    Does this mean we might be seeing compatibility between Moodle and HHVM as of 2.5.0? From what I have heard there is at least some interest within the Moodle community for reaching HHVM compliance, with the lack of mysqli being the chief show stopper.

    We have deployed Moodle for one of our educational clients. It is a beast of a PHP app (both in terms of size and runtime complexity), and it would be interesting to see how well it runs under HHVM.

  content: I've been using hhvm for my site for over 6 months and have never looked
    back. The best stack has to be nginx with spdy enabled, fastcgi and hhvm. I rarely
    see CPU usage rise over 2% even during busy periods. You guys who are working
    on hhvm have created a true work of art. The only thing that I feel is missing
    is support for Unix sockets over fastcgi... Do you guys plan on implementing this
    any time soon?

It is that wonderful time again for an HHVM release. We're sticking to our [8 week release](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Release-Schedule) cadence to keep everything fresh and in your hands. Also, remember you can run the [nightly packages](http://www.hhvm.com/blog/3203/nightly-packages) if you want a bleeding edge feature.

<!--truncate-->

Install:

  * [Ubuntu 12.04](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-on-Ubuntu-12.04)  / [13.10](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-on-Ubuntu-13.10)


  * [Debian 7](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-on-Debian-7)


  * [Fedora 20](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-on-Fedora-20)


  * [Mint 16](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt-Packages-on-Mint-16)



![laravel-four-icon](/static/images/posts/laravel-four-icon1.png)![ci_logo_flame](static/images/posts/ci_logo_flame1.jpg)


This release has many exciting points. First of all, 4 more large frameworks now pass 100% of their unit tests (using phpunit 3.9) - Laravel, Mockery, PHPUnit and CodeIgniter. Remember to put HHVM in your [travis config](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2013-12-16-test-php-code-with-the-hiphop-vm/) and we just might do a drive-by and make them all pass.

Big fixes:




  * A full rewrite of the ini parser


  * Support for the same recursive `__get()` and `__set()` semantics as php-src


  * Implemented `try {} finally {}`


  * Various reflection bugs


  * Turned on the Region JIT,  which makes the blocks of code that we translate larger giving more opportunity for speedups




![AesRockAppleseed](/static/images/posts/AesRockAppleseed1.jpg)![1200px-Beastie_Boys_Compo](/static/images/posts/1200px-Beastie_Boys_Compo1.jpg)![Coolio](/static/images/posts/Coolio1.jpg)


You might notice our new naming scheme for our[ 2 week releases.](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/NEWS) Since we are the HipHop team, we thought it would be fitting to use hiphop themed names. If you have suggestions for release names feel free to comment. Also, we noticed that there are 52 weeks in the year and with a release every 2 weeks, we can name them alphabetically and just perfectly fit. So far we've had Appleseed, Beastie Boys and Coolio.

Security Fixes:

[CVE-2014-1439](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2014-1439): [Fix libxml_disable_entity_loader()](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/95f96e7287effe2fcdfb9a5338d1a7e4f55b083b). This was also part of the 2.3.3 release.
