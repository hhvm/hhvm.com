As always, I'm really excited to see what our community has been building and saying, and really exited to share what I've seen with everyone!

## Github Projects

  * [Miles Johnson](https://github.com/milesj) has been working on [Titon, "a fullstack Hack framework"](https://github.com/titon/framework). It looks to intend to take Hack's full type system in mind, as well as follow the [PHP-FIG PSR standards](http://www.php-fig.org/).

  * [Kyle Ferguson](https://github.com/kyleferguson) has been working on [his Senary framework](https://github.com/senary/core), a "Hack framework for building scalable software". He has also [released the Vagrant "Harbor" environment](https://github.com/senary/harbor) he is using to work on it.

  * [Michael Crumm](https://github.com/mcrumm) recently [built a starter for Vindinium](https://github.com/mcrumm/vindinium-hacklang) written in Hack. (If you're not familiar with Vindinium, it's [a rather neat AI programming challenge](http://vindinium.org/).)


## Blog Posts / Other


  * The [Kontextful site, written in Hack running on HHVM](http://kontextful.com/), is up and running. It's based on the [open source hack-mvc framework](https://github.com/esokullu/hack-mvc) mentioned in a previous roundup.

  * [Davey Shafik](https://blog.engineyard.com/authors/Davey%20Shafik), whose blog posts I have mentioned in a previous roundup, is continuing his series with [a post on typedefs, shapes, XHP, and short lambdas](https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/hhvm-hack-part-4) as well as [a post on running the typechecker, editor integration, and conversion](https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/hhvm-hack-part-5).

  * [Tobias Nyholm](https://github.com/Nyholm) built a [30-weekday course "Daily bits of Hack"](http://www.dailybitsof.com/courses/30-days-of-hack-hhvm), which provides a short introduction to various Hack topics via email every weekday for 30 days.

  * Along with the Senary framework above, Kyle Ferguson also [gave a talk on the Hack language](http://www.slideshare.net/kylegferg/intro-to-hack-hhvm).

  * [Alexander Mols](https://github.com/asm89) similarly [gave a talk on HHVM and Hack](https://speakerdeck.com/asm89/hhvm) at the recent Dutch PHP conference.

  * For French language speakers, Benjamin Clay and Mathieu Darse [gave a talk about HHVM and Hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd6ewyJ2_DQ) at the recent [PHP Tour Lyon 2014](http://afup.org/pages/phptourlyon2014/). ([Slides](http://jolicode.github.io/hhvm-hack-conf/))
