HHVM 4.136 is released! HHVM 4.131&ndash;4.135 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Add IDE quickfix for missing interface methods.
- [The `readonly` feature](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/readonly/introduction) is no longer considered unstable.
- The `readonly` modifier is now available in the reflection API via the `isReadonly()` or `returnsReadonly()` functions.
- A new option `-vEval.JitAttemptSuperInlining=true` is added to `hhvm` to enable super inlining optimization.
- The [WriteHandle::truncate] method is added to HSL for writable files.
- Various APIs in HSL are now considered pure and no longer require the [defaults capabilities](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/contexts-and-capabilities/introduction).
- The `--custom-hhi-path` option is added to hh_client and hh_server.
- The `noreturn` type now can be upcasted to `dynamic`.

# Breaking Changes

- Methods with a `private final` modifier are not supported any more. Use `private` instead.
- The `partial` typing mode is removed. This includes both support for `<?hh // partial` in .php files, and for .hackpartial files.
- Raise an error when a trait is `<<__ConsistentConstruct>>` but does not declare an explicit constructor.
