HHVM 4.136 is released! HHVM 4.131&ndash;4.135 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Add quickfix for missing interface methods

# Breaking Changes

- Methods with a `private final` modifier are not supported any more. Use `private` instead.
- The `partial` typing mode is removed. This includes both support for <?hh // partial in .php files, and for .hackpartial files.
- Raise an error when a trait is <<__ConsistentConstruct>> but does not declare an explicit constructor.


# Future Changes

- TODO
