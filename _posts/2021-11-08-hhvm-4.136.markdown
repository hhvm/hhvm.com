HHVM 4.136 is released! HHVM 4.131&ndash;4.135 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Support union types in `Shapes.toArray`. For example, `Shapes::toDict(shape("foo" => 42, "bar" => 1.3))` is now typed as `dict<string, num>` instead of `dict<arraykey, mixed>`.
- TODO

# Breaking Changes

- Methods with a `private final` modifier are not supported any more. Use `private` instead;
- The `partial` typing mode is removed. This includes both support for <?hh // partial in .php files, and for .hackpartial files.

# Future Changes

- TODO
