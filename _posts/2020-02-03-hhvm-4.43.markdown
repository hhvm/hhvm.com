HHVM 4.43 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.36;
HHVM 4.37&ndash;4.42 remain supported, as do the 4.8 and 4.32 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- We are now building Homebrew packages for MacOS 10.15 Catalina. Please report
  MacOS-specific issues in the
  [homebrew-hhvm](https://github.com/hhvm/homebrew-hhvm/issues/new)
  repository.
- Extending an undefined parent class no longer produces a redundant typechecker
  error 4123 ("Class has a non-<?hh grandparent"), it now only produces the
  relevant error 2049 ("Unbound name").
- Improved typechecker error message when attempting to declare the type of a
  local variable (`int $x = 42;`).

# Breaking Changes

- Built-in functions `json_decode`, `str_split`, `array_fill`,
  `class_implements`, `class_uses`, `class_parents` now return `darray` instead
  of the legacy `array` type. This change should be largely transparent, as
  `darray` and `array` are interchangeable at runtime, but the change might be
  observable by `serialize`, `var_dump` or similar functions.
  - For `json_decode`, this also changes the behavior for arrays with numeric
    keys stored as `string`s, they will no longer be automatically cast to
    `int`.
- The `contains` method on `Set`, `ImmSet` and `ConstSet` is now declared to
  take an `arraykey` argument instead of `mixed`. The method would already throw
  at runtime when called with any non-`arraykey` value.
