HHVM 4.134 is released! HHVM 4.129&ndash;4.133 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- `ext_curl` will now cache TLS certificates between requests if HHVM is built against Curl v7.46.0 or newer.
- added `HH\Lib\Ref::get()` and `::set($value)` - direct property access is still supported.
- Added `HH\Lib\Async\Poll::waitUntilEmptyAsync()` for convenience and clarity when only the side effects of the
  Awaitables are needed, such as when running an event loop.

# Breaking Changes

- It is now an unfixmeable parse error to attempt to write to object properties
  in a pure function.
