HHVM 4.159 is released! This release marks the end of support of 4.153; 4.154 -
4.158 remain supported, as does the 4.128 LTS release.

# Highlights

- Add an attribute `<<__SafeGlobalVariable>>` to mark global variables as safe,
  ensuring no errors/warnings would be raised from writing to this global
  variable, when `--enable-global-write-check` is passed to `hh_server`.
- Add a quickfix for missing switch fallthrough comment (`// FALLTHROUGH`).

# Breaking Changes

- Make all array index read error codes the same. The error code 4435, 4298, and
  4005 are replaced by 4324.
