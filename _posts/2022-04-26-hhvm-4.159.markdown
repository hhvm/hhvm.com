HHVM 4.159 is released! 4.154 -
4.158 remain supported, as does the 4.128 and 4.153 LTS release.

# Highlights

- Add an attribute `<<__SafeGlobalVariable>>` to mark global variables as safe,
  ensuring no errors/warnings would be raised from writing to this global
  variable, when `--enable-global-write-check` is passed to `hh_server`. Note
  that this attribute will be renamed to `<<__SafeForGlobalWriteCheck>>` in the
  next release.
- Add a quickfix for missing switch fallthrough comment (`// FALLTHROUGH`).

# Breaking Changes

- Make all array index read error codes the same. The error code 4435, 4298, and
  4005 are replaced by 4324.
