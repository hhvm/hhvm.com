HHVM 4.10 is released! This release marks the end of support for the 4.4.x
series.

# Highlights

- Callable properties can now be invoked by parenthesizing,
  e.g. `($foo->bar)()`.
- await expressions are now supported in XHP contexts, e.g.
  `<foo bar={await baz()}>{await foo()}</foo>`.

# Breaking Changes

- runtime support for alternate control-flow syntax (`if: else: endif;`) has
  been removed; this was previously banned by the typechecker in hack files, but
  supported at runtime.
- warnings are now raised when arguments to builtin Hack functions are coerced
  to match the type.
- by-ref assignemnts (`$x = &$y`) are no longer supported by the parser.
