HHVM 4.39 is released! Since the 4.32 release has long term support, it remains
supported, as do the 4.8 LTS and 4.33&ndash;4.38 releases.

# Highlights

- Removed redundant typechecker output for some errors related to type constants
  (such as the second part of "Expected ClassName::T / resulting from expanding
  the type constant ClassName::T").

# Breaking Changes

- Improved typechecker output for errors related to mismatches between `int`,
  `float`, `num` and
  [`dynamic`](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/built-in-types/dynamic). In rare cases
  this may result in a typechecker error moving to a different location, e.g.
  from where a value is assigned to where it is used.
- The callback passed to `set_pre_timeout_handler()` must now accept a nullable
  wait handle argument (`?Awaitable<mixed>`). The wait handle will have a value
  when the callback is invoked right after a wait handle had finished. The wait
  handle is required in order to get a good backtrace. This is a similar
  behavior to the wait handle that is returned in the
  [`IntervalTimer`](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/reference/class/IntervalTimer/)
  class.
