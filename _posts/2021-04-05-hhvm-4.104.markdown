HHVM 4.104 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.98;
HHVM 4.99&ndash;4.103 remain supported, as do the 4.56, and 4.80 LTS releases.

Note that HHVM 4.104 is not a long-term support (LTS) release as originally
scheduled. Instead, HHVM 4.102 was
[promoted to a LTS release](/blog/2021/03/29/extending-hhvm-4.102-support.html).

# Highlights

- Added support for
  [Facts and native autoloader](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/pull/8816).
  This currently requires a separate installation of
  [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/), but we're working on a
  stand-alone implementation that doesn't require Watchman (at the cost of
  decreased performance for large repositories), as well as potentially
  including Watchman in official HHVM packages.
- Various IDE integration improvements (autocomplete, go-to-definition,
  tooltips).

# Breaking Changes

- We no longer build packages for MacOS 10.14 (Mojave).
