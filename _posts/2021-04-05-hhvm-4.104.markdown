HHVM 4.104 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.56 (LTS)
and 4.98; HHVM 4.99&ndash;4.103 remain supported, as does the 4.80 LTS release.

Note that HHVM 4.104 is not a long-term support (LTS) release as originally
scheduled. Instead, HHVM 4.102 was
[promoted to a LTS release](/blog/2021/03/29/extending-hhvm-4.102-support.html).

# Highlights

  tooltips).
