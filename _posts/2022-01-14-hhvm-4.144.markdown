HHVM 4.144 is released! This release marks the end of support of 4.136;
4.137, 4.138, 4.139, 4.140, 4.143 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.
4.141 and 4.142 were cancelled due to the holiday season.


# Highlights

- The type checker now truncates the error message when printing out a type, in case of hanging the type checker if the type is complicated. The threshold can be configured via the `hh_client --config type_printer_fuel=N` option.
- `classname<E>` where `E` is an enum now supports dynamic.

# Breaking Changes

- Local coeffects are enforced at runtime (previously coeffect errors were only reported in the type checker, not runtime).
- An error will be thrown when a global is accessed in a `read_globals` context without an enclosing `readonly` modifier.
