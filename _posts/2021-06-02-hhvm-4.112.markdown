HHVM 4.112 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.106;
HHVM 4.107&ndash;4.111 remain supported, as do the 4.80 and 4.102 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- A new built-in method `ReflectionTypeConstant::getTypeStructure()` was added
  (it had already been available in HHVM, but previously not recognized by the
  typechecker).
- Type constants on `this` (e.g. `this::T`) can now be used as reified generic
  type parameters. Note that the type `this` itself is still not allowed as a
  reified generic type parameter.

# Breaking Changes

- The typechecker now raises an error if the built-ins `echo` and `print` are
  used with arguments that are not `int` or `string`.
- Fixed a bug where the typechecker would not correctly enforce generic type
  constraints on opaque type aliases (e.g. `newtype X<T as arraykey> = T;`).
  This may reveal some previously undetected errors.
