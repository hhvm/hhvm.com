HHVM 4.161 is released! 4.156 - 4.160 remain supported,
as do the 4.128 and 4.153 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Autocomplete stops offering type completions in top-level expressions, since
  no valid ones start with a type.
- Fixes a typechecker bug that didn't allow a trait with a `require class C`
  constraint to access the protected members of the parents of `C`
- The docblock parser stops considering lines commented with `//` as part of the
  docblock if there are completely empty lines between that comment line and the
  definition being documented. This fixes some cases where file-level comments
  were being spuriously considered part of the docblock for the first thing
  defined in the file.
- The `apc_fetch_with_pure_wakeup`, `apc_store_with_pure_sleep`, and
  `apc_add_with_pure_sleep` APIs were published. These allow interacting with APC
  while enforcing that the `__sleep` and `__wakeup` magic methods won't observe
  global state or produce side-effects.
