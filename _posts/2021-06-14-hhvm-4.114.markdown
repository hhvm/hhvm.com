HHVM 4.114 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.108;
HHVM 4.109&ndash;4.113 remain supported, as do the 4.80 and 4.102 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Fixed a bug that prevented passing
  [`dynamic`](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/built-in-types/dynamic)-typed
  arguments to some
  [Hack Standard Library](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/getting-started/the-standard-library)
  functions.
- Fixed a bug where HHVM would crash when the negation (`!`) operator is used
  on some comparisons of array-typed values
  (e.g. `!(vec[2,3,4] == vec[1,2,3])`).

# Future Changes

- In a future release, we expect the typechecker to start enforcing that
  arguments provided to the
  [`<<__Sealed(...)>>` attribute](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/attributes/predefined-attributes#__sealed)
  are actually existing subclasses/implementations of the annotated
  class/interface.
