HHVM 4.140 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.134; HHVM
4.135&ndash;4.139 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.

v4.140 is the last release in 2021. Happy Holidays!

# Highlights

- Various bug fixes for the `readonly` data types.
- Various error message improvements.
- The typechecker now understands the coeffects of `\preg_replace_callback()` and `\preg_replace_callback_with_error()`. See [this commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/c8f8f0c9eaf73612427476e46698aafbb3037c60) for the new signature.

# Breaking Changes

- `JitAHotSize` and `JitAProfSize` runtime options are removed
- Ban `UNSAFE_CAST` in lvalues and `await` operands. The following code does not type-check any more:
  - `HH\FIXME\UNSAFE_CAST<mixed, dict<int, string>>($m)[0] = "lvalue";`
  - `await HH\FIXME\UNSAFE_CAST<Awaitable<mixed>, Awaitable<int>>(foo());`
- Now a `clone` of a `readonly` object is also `readonly`.
- The functions `\preg_replace_callback()` and `\preg_replace_callback_with_error()` now take a `(function(darray<arraykey, string>)[_]: string)` as the second parameter in the typechecker, instead of an untyped value.
