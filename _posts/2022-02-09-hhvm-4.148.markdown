HHVM 4.148 is released! This release marks the end of support of 4.140;
4.143 - 4.147 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Fixed error where libelf may not be found
- Autocomplete now suggests enum values for function parameters
- Added `HH\Readonly\Shapes` class, partially mirroring the `Shapes` class
- `HH\Lib\Str\length()` now takes advantage of JIT optimizations that were
  previously exclusive to `\strlen()`

# Breaking Changes

- function bodies are now required for non-builtin functions.
