HHVM 4.61 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.55;
HHVM 4.56&ndash;4.60 remain supported, as does the 4.32 LTS release.

# Highlights

- The typechecker no longer reports multiple redundant errors when a class
  (interface) is extended (implemented) with incompatible generic type
  parameters
  ([example](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/ba6a6cb57eabd7135e5aeb169c306d53b454dc44/hphp/hack/test/typecheck/constraints/extend_generic2.php)).
- Fixed a bug where using `array_unshift` on a `keyset` could cause the `keyset`
  to contain multiple identical values.

# Future Changes

- Support for `HH_IGNORE_ERROR` may be removed in the future, making `HH_FIXME`
  the only way to silence typechecker errors.
  - You can add `disable_hh_ignore_error=true` to your `.hhconfig` to get this
    behavior now.
