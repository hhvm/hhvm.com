We have decided to skip this week's regular release, HHVM 4.70.

There's been a regression that prevented us from publishing the release earlier
this week, which we are still working on fixing. Instead of shipping the release
only a few days before the next one, we decided to skip it.

Support for HHVM 4.64 will be extended until the release of HHVM 4.71, scheduled
for next week.
