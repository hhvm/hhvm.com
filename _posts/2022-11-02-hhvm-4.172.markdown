HHVM 4.172 is released! 4.169 - 4.171 remain supported, as do the 4.168 
and 4.153 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Fixed a bug preventing classes using a trait with `require class <that class>`
  from being mocked.
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/fa23fd50c869719a1ce4aa2b75c248dc0686d814))
- Regular expression functions now have a new error type, for when regular
  expressions jitted by PCRE run out of scratch space: PREG_JIT_STACKLIMIT_ERROR
  These would previously be reported as generic internal errors, which made
  debugging tricky.

# Breaking Changes

- Two compiler options have been renamed - when compiling a repo the compiler
  will no longer accept `--module` or `--cmodule` options as of this release.
  Please use their new names `--dir` and `--cdir` instead (new names added in
  release 4.169). This change is intended to avoid confusion wht the 'modules'
  experimental feature.
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/7859f697fb9bb539967bc5dfa9d22bce093c1a0a))
- The typechecker now disallows overriding an async method with a non-async one.
  This was previously allowed as long as the types in the signature were
  compatible, but this made it easy to accidentally write subtle bugs by leaving
  off the async keyword on the overriding method.
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/415b6f84cf03aff4f31c2e963bd6576d70317ae5))
- When using the 'modules' experimental feature, note that the default value of
  the Eval.EnforceModules runtime option is changing from 1 (warn) to 2 (throw
  exceptions).
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/886a89f73db31d7904c1692f659bdf4f5aa4900e))
- When using the like_type_hints experimental feature, note that this release
  changes how these types (the union of `dynamic` and another type; e.g. `~int`
  for the union of `dynamic` and `int`) are enforced in argument and return type
  positions. Previously they were enfoced the same as the `dynamic` type (i.e.
  any value would be accepted) but after this release they are enforced as the
  other type in the union would be (e.g. for `~int` only integer values will
  now be accepted).

  via helpers in the `HH\FIXME` namespace.
