HHVM 4.162 is released! 4.159 - 4.161 remain supported,
as do the 4.128 and 4.153 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Autocomplete improvements to:
  - `parent::__construct`
  - the first keyword (e.g. the visibility keyword on a method) in the body of a
    class, interface, or trait
  - `implements` and `extends`
- Supports type refinements for readonly expressions
- A Hack property is now considered as a Field instead of a Property in an IDE
- Adds a lint rule for invalid XHP class enum values
- Passing an `\Error` as the `$previous` argument to the `\Error` constructor does not violate an internal typed property anymore. The argument to the constructor has/had the `?\Throwable` type, but the `$throwable->previous` property had the `?\Exception` type. Depending on the value of `hhvm.check_prop_type_hints` key in your configuration, this violation used to trigger a warning (the default), throw an `\Error`, or do nothing.

# Breaking Changes

- Added stricter types for `Exception`, `Error`, and `Throwable` methods and properties
