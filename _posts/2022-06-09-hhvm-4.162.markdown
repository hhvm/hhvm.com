HHVM 4.162 is released! 4.159 - 4.161 remain supported,
as do the 4.128 and 4.153 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Autocomplete improvements to:
  - `parent::__construct`
  - the first keyword (e.g. the visibility keyword on a method) in the body of a
    class, interface, or trait
  - `implements` and `extends`
- Supports type refinements for readonly expressions
- Hack properties are now considered as the LSP kind "Field" for IDEs
  (previously the LSP kind "Property")
- Adds a lint rule for invalid XHP class enum values

# Breaking Changes

- Added stricter types for `BaseException` and `Throwable` methods and properties
