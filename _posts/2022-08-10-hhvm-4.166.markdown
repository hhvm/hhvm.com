HHVM 4.166 is released! 4.163 - 4.165 remain supported, as do the 4.128 and
4.153 LTS releases.

# Dropping support for Ubuntu 21.04 and 21.10

This release does not compile on Ubuntu 21.04 and 21.10. Both versions
have reached End of Life earlier this year according to
[this post](https://fridge.ubuntu.com/2022/01/21/ubuntu-21-04-hirsute-hippo-end-of-life-reached-on-january-20-2022/)
and [this
post](https://fridge.ubuntu.com/2022/06/01/ubuntu-21-10-impish-indri-reaches-end-of-life-on-july-14-2022/).
We are aware that we have not provided deb packages for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. For
now, Ubuntu 22.04 users could try [our experimental HHVM binary built with Nix](https://hhvm.com/blog/2022/07/12/experimenting-with-nix-github-actions-and-visual-studio-code.html),
which should be able to run on any Linux distribution.

# Highlights

- Added support for upcasts in initializer expressions, e.g. `class C { public dynamic $d
  = 3 upcast dynamic; }`
- Added support for typechecking quote flag `%'(char)` in `sprintf`.
- Added support for `<<__Docs("http://example.com")>>` to `type`, `newtype`,
  `enum`s and `enum class`es, which shows the docs URL in the IDE's hover information
- Added a quickfix for Lint 5643 (Comparing booleans with values)

  

# Breaking Changes

<!-- We are making progress in implicit contexts -->

- Memoized functions with any of the following attributes now require the defaults
  capability:
  - `<<__Memoize(#SoftMakeICInaccessible)>>`
  - `<<__Memoize(#MakeICInaccessible)>>`
  - `<<__PolicyShardedMemoize>>`
  - `<<__PolicyShardedMemoizeLSB>>`
- Mark `spl_object_hash` as taking readonly
- Make `null` default parameter with non-nullable type hint result in error
- Always error on nested Expression Trees
- Lambdas and calls in Expression Trees are now virtualized:
  - Lambdas are now wrapped in `lambdaType(...)`.
  - Calls are now translated to `__unwrap()` method instead of direct invoking.
