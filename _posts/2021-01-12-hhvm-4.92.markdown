HHVM 4.92 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.83;
HHVM 4.84&ndash;4.91 remain supported, as do the 4.56 and 4.80 LTS releases.

(Note: HHVM 4.85, 4.89 and 4.90 were skipped.)

# Highlights

- If a class A is a supertype of class/interface B via `require extends`, it
  is now able to call its' own private methods on instances of B.
- Replaced sometimes-confusing "expected dynamic, got nonnull" with clearer
  "expected dynamic, got mixed". While `nonnull` was technically accurate (as
  `mixed` is `?nonnull`), some users misinterpreted the error as meaning that
  `null` was expected, or still consider `mixed` values to be `mixed` after a
  null check.

# Breaking Changes

- Corrected error line number for reified generic errors; FIXME comments may
  need to be moved.
- The `APCIterator` class has been removed from the runtime, as it has generally
  not been kept up to date or correct, and was not exposed to the typechecker.
- `apc_cache_info()` now correctly returns an `uncounted_entries` key instead of
  `uncounted_entires`.
- Calling methods on `dynamic` values requires that all values are coercible to
  `dynamic`, and the return type will be `dynamic`.
- it is now a syntax error to declare a function as `async` without an
  `Awaitable` return type; previously this was separately checked by the type
  checker and the bytecode emitter, and the typechecker did not detect invalid
  async lambdas.
