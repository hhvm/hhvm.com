HHVM 4.81 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.75;
HHVM 4.76&ndash;4.80 remain supported, as does the 4.56 LTS release.

# Highlights

- A new built-in type `AnyArray` was added, representing the parent type of all
  containers that are *values* (`vec`, `dict`, `keyset`, `varray`, `darray`;
  does not include containers with *reference* semantics like `Vector`). It is
  a subtype of `KeyedContainer`.

# Breaking Changes

- The INI option `hhvm.hack_arr_dv_arr_var_dump` was removed. `var_dump` will
  now always output `varray` or `darray` instead of `array`.

# Future Changes

- Similarly to `var_dump`, `var_export` will also start distinguishing between
  `varray` and `darray`.
  - Use the INI option `hhvm.hack_arr_dv_arr_var_export=1` to enable this
    behavior now.
- Support for `#` comments will be removed in a future release.
  Use `//` or `/*` instead.
  - [Shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) at the beginning of
    a Hack file will stay supported.
