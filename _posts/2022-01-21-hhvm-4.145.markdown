HHVM 4.145 is released! This release marks the end of support of 4.137;
4.138, 4.139, 4.140, 4.143, 4.144 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.
4.141 and 4.142 were cancelled due to the holiday season.


# Highlights

- Support throw on dynamic, e.g. `function foo(dynamic $d): void { throw $d; }`
- Attributes on class constants do not result errors any more (assessing the attributes via runtime reflection is still not yet supported)
- The built-in function `gethostname` is now a pure function.

# Breaking Changes

- Raise the typing error 4068 on `?mixed` and similar if they're in a type hint position, including `f<?mixed>()` or `new C<?mixed>()`.
- Reject calls in l-value position, such as `(foo($x))[3] = 'a'` or `(bar($y))[] = 45`.
- The built-in function `curl_multi_exec` now requires `int` as the second parameter.
