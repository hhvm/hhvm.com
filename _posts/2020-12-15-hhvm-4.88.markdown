HHVM 4.88 is released!
HHVM 4.82&ndash;4.87 remain supported, as do the 4.56 and 4.80 LTS releases.

We intend to skip 4.89 and 4.90 due to the holiday season; support for 4.82 and
4.83 will be extended until the release of 4.91 and 4.92 respectively.

# Highlights

- Error messages for parse errors now include file name and line number again.

# Breaking Changes

- Unrecoverable fatals such as parse errors no longer throw, so are no longer
  catchable. If you are using `try`/`catch` around `require()` (e.g. to attempt
  to find an autoloader), `HH\could_include()` is a useful replacement.
- We are no longer building for Ubuntu 19.10 'Eoan Ermine', as we are no longer
  able to fetch the dependencies from upstream repositories. Ubuntu 19.10
  reached end of life on the 17th of July, 2020.
