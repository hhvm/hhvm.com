HHVM 4.167 is released! 4.164 - 4.166 remain supported, as do the 4.128 and
4.153 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Hover information has improved for constants, type names and enum
  classes.
- More of the built-in extensions (`ext_json`, `ext_folly_variant`,
  `ext_thrift`, `ext_zlib`, `ext_server`, `ext_enum`) have more
  extensive typing in their .hhi files, so the type checker can check
  code using them.
- `.hackpartial` settings in `.hhconfig` have been removed,
  specifically `allowed_fixme_codes_partial`, `codes_not_raised_partial`
  and `strict_codes`.
- `hh_client` now supports a `--is-subtype` to see if types are
  compatible, using JSON from `--type-at-pos`
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/a5c0413f434f7b736e5a876f0af769e1e3ed694c)).
- HHVM now supports overriding type constants on interfaces, even if
  they're not abstract
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/90d7b5c55ea2c5d9ca756a96a706a362aca0fadf)).

# Breaking Changes

- Having both `<<__Memoize>>` and `<<__MemoizeLSB>>` on a method
  is now a type error.
