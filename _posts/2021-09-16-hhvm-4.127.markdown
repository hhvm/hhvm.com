HHVM 4.127 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.121; HHVM 4.122&ndash;4.126 remain supported, as do the 4.80 and 4.102 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Clearer typechecker errors when an attribute is passed the wrong number of
  arguments.
- add `Str\foo_l()` functions taking a `Locale\Locale()` object, and supporting
  UTF8 (via `Locale\create('en_US.UTF-8')`, for example). We recommend only
  using these functions when locale or multibyte-character awareness is
  explicitly required, as:
  - the non-`_l` functions are more performant
  - the implementation works on normalized UTF-16, which can mean that a
    `Str\ends_with_l()` call returns true when a string ends with the same
    characters, but in a different byte sequence, potentially of a different
    length.
- Corrected behavior of `__FILE__` in trait methods.
- Added `crypto_core_ristretto255_from_hash()` and `sodium_crypto_scalarmult_ristretto255()` when
  supported by system libsodium.
- Added the `sodium_crypto_secretstream` family of functions.

# Breaking Changes

- The `.hhconfig` flag `disallow_partially_abstract_typeconst_definitions` is
  now true by default, and will be removed in a future release. This bans
  declarations of the form `const type T as Y = Z`.
- `foo()::$static_prop = 1` is now a runtime error, instead of only a
  typechecker error.
