HHVM 3.30.7, 4.8.2, 4.12.1, 4.13.1, 4.14.1, 4.15.1, 4.16.2, and 4.17.1 are now
available; these are non-urgent bugfix releases, containing fixes backported
from later releases.

| Versions | Issue
| - | -
| 4.16, 4.17 | Fixed a bug where HackC would access shared memory (unneeded by HackC), leading to an exception being thrown.
| 3.30, 4.8, 4.12-4.14 | Fixed a bug when using CLI server mode that could lead to CLI clients hanging forever when the script is finished.
| 3.30, 4.8 | Improve reliability when Xenon is enabled by using `SIGPROF` instead of `SIGVTALRM`, and by ignoring Xenon signals if received extremely early in HHVM startup
| 4.8 | Fix crash when attempting to use repo-authorititative mode on MacOS
