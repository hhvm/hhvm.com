HHVM 4.135 is released! HHVM 4.130&ndash;4.134 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.

This release primarily contains stability and performance improvements, and work towards future features that are not yet supported.

# Highlights

- If using Watchman, fixed a potential deadlock when connecting. 

# Breaking Changes

- If a function intercept handler throws an exception, the intercepted functions' exception handler is no longer used.

# Future Changes

- We are now actively working towards removing support for 'partial' mode.
