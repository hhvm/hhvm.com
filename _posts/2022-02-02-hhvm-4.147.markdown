HHVM 4.147 is released! This release marks the end of support of 4.139;
4.140, and 4.143 - 4.146 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.
4.141 and 4.142 were cancelled due to the holiday season.

# Highlights

- Add coeffects to `thrift_protocol_set_compact_version`, `DateTime` and `mbstring` functions.
- Support hover and go-to-definition on type parameters in an IDE.
- Support hover and go-to-definition on the `abstract` keyword in an IDE.

# Breaking Changes

- The result of `HH\FIXME\UNSAFE_CAST` is now considered `readonly` if the input is `readonly`.
- Always raise an error when inheriting members that differ only by case (previously the error would be raised only if `case_sensitive_inheritance` option is enabled)
