HHVM 4.38 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.31;
4.32&ndash;4.36 remain supported, as does the 4.8 LTS release.

The [4.37 release was skipped](https://hhvm.com/blog/2019/12/17/cancelling-hhvm-4.37.html)
due to the holiday season.

# Highlights

- Added `SA_RESTART` to `SIGVTALARM` flags, allowing operations such as `flock`
  to continue when interrupted by some profiling tools, instead of failing
  with `EINTR`.
- Changed typechecker definitions of base64/url/rawurl encode/decode
  functions to return `string`, rather than untyped data. They already always
  returned strings in the runtime.

# Breaking Changes

- building with readline now requires `-DNON_DISTRIBUTABLE_BUILD=ON` to be
  passed to `cmake`; editline remains supported as the default implementation,
  and this does not affect our builds. In custom builds, `hphpd` and the PHP
  readline-related functions may switch to using editline instead of readline.
- using assignments as an expression is now a typechecker error. This can
  temporarily be disabled by setting the `disable_lval_as_an_expression=false`
  `.hhconfig` option; this option will be removed in a future release.
