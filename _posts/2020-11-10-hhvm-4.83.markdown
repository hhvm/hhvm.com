HHVM 4.83 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.77;
HHVM 4.78&ndash;4.82 remain supported, as does the 4.56 LTS release.

# Breaking Changes

- Attributes used on lambda functions must now be
  [defined](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/attributes/introduction#defining-an-attribute), similarly to attributes used in any other position. To allow an attribute to
  be used on lambda functions, its definition must implement the interface
  `\HH\LambdaAttribute`.
- The option `hhvm.hack.lang.enable_first_class_function_pointers` was removed.
  The new
  [function reference](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/functions/function-references)
  syntax is now always enabled.
- The option `hhvm.emit_cls_meth_pointers` is now enabled by default. It causes
  the built-in function `class_meth()` to return values in the same format as
  the new *function reference* syntax, which should make migrating easier.
  - For easier migration, the additional option
    `hhvm.is_compatible_cls_meth_type = 1` can be used to
    allow both formats to be considered valid.

# Future Changes

- The built-in functions `fun()` and `class_meth()` will be removed in a future
  release. Use the new
  [function reference](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/functions/function-references)
  syntax instead.
  - The option `hhvm.hack.lang.disallow_fun_and_cls_meth_pseudo_funcs = 1` can
    be used to disable these functions in the current HHVM release.
