HHVM 4.15 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.9;
4.10-4.14 remain supported, as do the LTS releases 3.30 and 4.8.

# Highlights

- IDE integrations now show docblocks for namespaced functions.
- Fixed an issue that could lead to CLI server clients hanging on exit in some
  Linux environments.
- Improved typing of `noreturn` methods.

# Breaking Changes

- Untyped variadics now raise type errors; replace with `mixed ...$foo`.
- `inout` parameter types are now invariant - both co- and contra- variant.
  They were previously incorrectly treated as contravariant.
- `instanceof` is now a parse error. In 4.14.x, it was not a parser error, but
  no longer refined types. In HHAST 4.14.x, `hhast-migrate --instanceof-is` can
  be used to replace expressions of the form `$x instanceof Foo` with
  `$x is Foo`, and expressions of the form `$x instanceof $some_expression` with
  `\is_a($x, $some_expression)`.

# Future Changes

- In a future release, all support for calling functions by-reference will be
  removed. Typechecker enforcement can be enabled now with the
  `disallow_byref_calls=true` `.hhconfig` option.
- Support for `"${foo}"` will be removed, and can be replaced with `"{$foo}"`;
  `hhast-migrate --dollar-brace-variable-migration` can be used to migrate
  code, and the `disable_outside_dollar_str_interp=true` `.hhconfig` setting can
  be used to enforce this immediately.
