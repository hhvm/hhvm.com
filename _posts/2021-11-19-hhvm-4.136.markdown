HHVM 4.136 is released! HHVM 4.131&ndash;4.135 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Add IDE quickfix for missing interface methods.
- [The `readonly` feature](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/readonly/introduction) is no longer considered unstable.
- The `readonly` modifier is now available in the reflection API via the `isReadonly()` or `returnsReadonly()` functions.
- A experimental option `hhvm.jit_attempt_super_inlining` is added to `.hhconfig`, which enables a novel strategy in HHVM attempting to const fold nearly-const
values.
- The [WriteHandle::truncate] method is added to HSL for writable files.
- Various APIs in HSL are now considered pure or `controlled` and no longer require the [defaults capabilities](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/contexts-and-capabilities/introduction).
- The `noreturn` type now can be upcasted to `dynamic`.

# Breaking Changes

- Methods with a `private final` modifier are not supported any more. Use `private` instead.
- The `partial` typing mode is removed. This includes both support for `<?hh // partial` in `.php` files, and for `.hackpartial` files.
- Raise an error when a trait is `<<__ConsistentConstruct>>` but does not declare an explicit constructor.
