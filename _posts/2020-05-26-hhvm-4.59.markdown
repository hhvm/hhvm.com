HHVM 4.59 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.53;
HHVM 4.54&ndash;4.58 remain supported, as does the 4.32 LTS release.

# Highlights

- Improved output of `hh_client` to more accurately describe the status of the
  server in various cases.

# Breaking Changes

- The typechecker now raises an error if any attribute arguments
  (`<<Attr('arg1', 'arg2')>>`) are not literal values. These had already been
  runtime errors.
  - Array, shape and tuple literals are allowed.
- The `.hhconfig` option `stronger_shape_idx_return` has been removed. This was
  an experimental option that was never enabled by default, so this change
  should not affect most users.
- If a `where` constraint on a constructor isn't satisfied at the point of using
  `new`, the typechecker would previously raise an error pointing to the
  constructor definition. Instead, it now points to the use (the `new`
  construct).
  - This provides more helpful output and fixes an issue where typechecking a
    file could raise an error in a different file, but it may require some
    `HH_FIXME`s to be moved.
