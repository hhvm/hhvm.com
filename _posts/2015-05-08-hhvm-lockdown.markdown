  content: "Awesome, can't wait to see the results! :)\r\n\r\nIt'd be particularly
    interesting to see how much faster the upcoming version 8 of Drupal will be, since
    PHP 7 is significantly faster than HHVM there: http:&#47;&#47;lerdorf.com&#47;d8.html#&#47;drupalbench.\r\n\r\nFeel
    free to ping me if you have questions regarding Drupal 8 :)"

    reach masses, masses use shared hosting."

    others."

    e.g., HHVM differing very slightly in the wording of error messages, things like
    that. If you're hitting a real issue, please file an issue on GitHub: https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;facebook&#47;hhvm&#47;issues\r\n\r\nBut
    most things are expected to work nowadays. :)"

![Neon Lockdown Sign](/static/images/posts/10537187_10152729686506660_886816697495269948_o-1.jpg){:loading="lazy"}

It's that time of year again! Next week the HHVM Open Source team is beginning aÂ lockdown. The next two weeks will feature beards, long hours, and performance wins. We're excited to announce that this will be our first ever open source performance lockdown.

<!--truncate-->

During lockdown we plan to focus our efforts on performance wins for Wordpress, Drupal, and MediaWiki. We're confident these gains will translate to many other popular frameworks. We will be tracking our efforts through [github issues](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/labels/lockdown), and measuring performance using our [benchmarking tool](https://github.com/hhvm/oss-performance).

Throughout the next two weeks we will continue to review pull requests and respond to issues, and will be prioritizing those related to performance. In particular we're soliciting pull requests for any of our lockdown issues, as well as novel performance tasks we hadn't thought to add. We hope you'll join in and help us make this lockdown a success.

Performance lockdowns have been an HHVM tradition for many years, and we can't wait to get the rest of the community involved. In addition to optimizing HHVM performance we're also looking at ways we may be able to contribute back to these frameworks, and exploring the best practices for [configuring HHVM](http://hhvm.com/blog/4061/go-faster) to run each framework efficiently.
