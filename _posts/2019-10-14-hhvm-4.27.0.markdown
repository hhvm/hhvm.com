HHVM 4.27 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.21;
4.22&ndash;4.26 remain supported, as do the LTS releases 3.30 and 4.8.

# Highlights

- Clearer typechecker error message when a function does not explicitly
  return a value in all branches
- Added 'jump-to-definition' for overridden methods
- go-to-implementation ("textDocument/implementation") is now implemented in
  LSP-based editors (e.g. Visual Studio Code) for common situations.
- added `set_pre_timeout_handler(int $seconds, 

# Breaking Changes

- `register_postsend_function()` and `register_shutdown_function()` now take
  a single `function(): T` argument, instead of a callable and variadic
  arguments
- `break` and `continue` with a level (e.g. `break 3;`) is now a parse error;
  previously, a typechecker error was raised
- usage of abstract type constants now raises a type error in some places where
  they do not have meaning (e.g.
  `abstract class C { abstract const type T; } function foo(C::T $x)`)

# Future Changes

- We aim to drop support for MacOS High Sierra (10.13) and introduce support for
  MacOS Catalina (10.15) as soon Catalina is available from our build
  infrastructure provider.
