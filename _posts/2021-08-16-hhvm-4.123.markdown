HHVM 4.123 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.117; HHVM 4.118&ndash;4.122 remain supported, as do the 4.80 and 4.102 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Improved typechecker error messages when refining objects to a class that doesn't exist.
- Indexing containers with covariant keys now results in a distinct, clearer, error (4449)
  if the key type is incompatible. Some FIXMes may need changing.
- LSP-based IDEs may now suggest quickfixes when calling typoed static/instance methods.

# Breaking Changes

- Arguments to `meth_caller()` must now be constants
