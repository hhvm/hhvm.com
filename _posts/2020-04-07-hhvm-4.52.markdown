HHVM 4.52 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.46;
HHVM 4.47&ndash;4.51 remain supported, as do the 4.8 and 4.32 LTS releases.

HHVM 4.52.1 fixes a regression introduced in 4.52.0, which made the typechecker
report Hack parse errors in PHP code, instead of ignoring actual PHP source
files.

# Highlights

- fixed crash in `ext_soap` if a SoapServer's handler class does not exist.
- `?>` and `<?=` are no longer recognized by the parser; this has replaced
  dedicated errors with parse errors.

# Breaking Changes

- it is now a type error to `use` the same trait twice in the same class; using
  the same trait in related classes (e.g. subclasses and parents) is still
  permitted.

# Future Changes

- Runtime support for casting objects to strings via `__toString` will be
  removed shortly; this includes `(string) $obj`, `print($obj)`,
  `sprintf('%s', $obj)` among others. The
  `hhvm.notice_on_implicit_invoke_to_string` INI setting can be used to find
  calls that will break.
