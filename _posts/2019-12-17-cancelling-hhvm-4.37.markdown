We have decided to cancel next weeks' release of HHVM 4.37, and expect to delay
4.38 until Thursday, the 2nd of January. HHVM 4.31 will be supported until the
release of HHVM 4.38 or above. As HHVM 4.32 has long-term-support (LTS), it is
unaffected by this change.

Our usual schedule is to release on Mondays or Tuesdays, and we expect many
people - both at Facebook, and among our users - to be on vacation for Tuesday
and Wednesday for the next two weeks - both at Facebook, and among our users. We
believe that releasing new versions with breaking changes at this time would not
be in the best interests of our users, especially as we would be less able to
support them during this time.

We look forward to continuing the releases in 2020.
