HHVM 4.9.1 is released, fixing a performance regression on MacOS. There are no
significant changes on other platforms.

We have added additional apt distributions to make it easier to update
to releases that are not the latest, but are still supported: for 4.3-4.9, we
have added `DISTRIBUTION-MAJOR.MINOR` apt distributions. For example, if your
`/etc/apt/sources.list` currently contains
`deb https://dl.hhvm.com/ubuntu bionic main`, you can replace `bionic` with
`bionic-4.3`, `bionic-4.4` etc through to `bionic-4.9`.

Given all new releases have overlapping support, we are no longer handling
LTS releases specially in apt; for example, the 4.8 series is available through
`bionic-4.8`. We have not changed the distribution names for past releases, so
3.30 remains available through `bionic-lts-3.30` instead of `bionic-3.30`.

We have also made similar changes to our MacOS bottles:

```
$ brew tap hhvm/hhvm
$ brew install hhvm # install the latest release
$ brew install hhvm-nightly # install the latest nightly build
$ brew install hhvm-4.8 # install the lastest 4.8.x
```

We have not renamed past releases, so 3.30 remains available as `hhvm@3.30-lts`
in homebrew.
