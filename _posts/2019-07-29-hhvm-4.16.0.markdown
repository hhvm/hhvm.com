HHVM 4.16 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.10;
4.11-4.15 remain supported, as do the LTS releases 3.30 and 4.8.

# Highlights

- typechecker error messages now suggest similar methods and variables

# Breaking Changes

- fixed a bug that would incorrectly typecheck most files containing XHP in partial mode instead of strict

```
class :a {
  attribute string foo;
  public function bar($baz): void {}
  //                  ^ previously undetected missing type annotation
}
```
