HHVM 4.22 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.16;
4.17-4.21 remain supported, as do the LTS releases 3.30 and 4.8.

# Highlights

- The Hack language parser has been rewritten in Rust (previously OCaml). In the
  previous two HHVM versions, using the new parser was optional, but this
  release completely removes the old parser and the new parser is now always
  used. This should not cause any user-facing changes, but if you see any
  differences in behavior or other issues, please
  [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/new).
- Fixed various bugs at [docs.hhvm.com](https://docs.hhvm.com/)
  (wrong namespaces, missing links, etc.)

# Breaking Changes

- fixed a bug that allowed arbitrary values to be coerced to `?dynamic`

```php
function foo(): ?dynamic {
  return 42;  // now an error
}
```

- it is now a typechecker error to specify generic type parameters for `dynamic` (previously they were simply ignored)
- fixed a bug that prevented the typechecker from correctly detecting conflicting `use const` declarations in some cases

```php
use const Foo\A as A;
...
use const Foo\B as A;  // now an error, previously not always an error
```
