HHVM 4.17 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.11;
4.12-4.16 remain supported, as do the LTS releases 3.30 and 4.8.

# Highlights

**Reified generics** are now supported. See
[full documentation](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/generics/reified-generics) and
[migration guide](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/generics/reified-generics-migration).

```php
function foo<reify T>(T $arg): void { ... }

foo<int>(42);
foo<string>(42);  // now a runtime error
```

Reified generic types can be used in the function code:

```php
abstract class BaseClass {
  abstract public function foo(): void;
}

// Before:
function bar(classname<BaseClass> $classname): void {
  $classname::foo();
}

// After:
function bar<reify T as BaseClass>(): void {
  T::foo();
}
```
