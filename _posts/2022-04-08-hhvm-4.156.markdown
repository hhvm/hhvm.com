HHVM 4.157 is released! This release marks the end of support of 4.149; 4.150 -
4.155 remain supported, as does the 4.128 LTS release.

# Highlights

- A lint error is no longer raised for `HH\FIXME_UNSAFE_CAST<mixed, T>($expr)`
  if the type of `$expr` is non-denotable and expression-dependent, e.g. if
  IDE hover information or `hh_client --type-at-pos` shows a type like
  `<expr#1>::T`
- `HH\serialize_with_options` now supports a `disallowObjects` option, which
  disallows serialization of objects except for legacy Hack Collections.
- Numeric literals can now contain underscores to improve code readability;
  for example, `$x = 1_234_567_890;` sets `$x` to the integer `1234567890`.
- Performance improvements for reified generics.
- All built-in attributes have IDE hover documentation.

# Breaking Changes

- lambdas contained within an anonymous function will no longer implicitly
  capture variables from the parent scope of the anonymous function, unless the
  variable is in the anonymous function's `use` clause
