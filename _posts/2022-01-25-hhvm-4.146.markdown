HHVM 4.146 is released! This release marks the end of support of 4.138;
4.139, 4.140, and 4.143 - 4.145 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.
4.141 and 4.142 were cancelled due to the holiday season.

# Highlights

- If options to log or forbid dynamic calls to class (static) methods are enabled, logging/errors will no longer be raised by calls to static methods on reified generics, e.g. `T::foo();`.


# Breaking Changes

- Coeffect violations now throw a `CoeffectViolationException` instead of a
 `BadMethodCallException`; both extend `LogicException`.
- It is now a parse error to declare a lambda/method/fuction parameter called
  `$this`; previously, any attempts to use it would be treated as references to
  the current object instance, not the parameter.
- `ob_get_contents()`, `ob_get_length()`, `ob_get_level()`, `ob_get_status`,
  `ob_list_handlers()`, `hphp_get_stats()`, `hphp_get_status()`,
  `hphp_get_io_status()`, `hphp_get_timers()`, `hphp_instruction_counter()`,
  and `hphp_get_hardware_counters()` are now marked as `[read_globals]`, so can
  no longer be called from 'pure' functions.
- diamond imports of traits are banned if the traits define generic properties as it can be unsound.
