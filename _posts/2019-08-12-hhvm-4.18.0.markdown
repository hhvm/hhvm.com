HHVM 4.18 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.12;
4.13-4.17 remain supported, as do the LTS releases 3.30 and 4.8.

This release only contains minor improvements/cleanups, but there is one notable
future change to be aware of.

# Future changes

- Typechecker error code 4110 (currently covering almost all "type mismatch"
  errors) will soon be replaced with several more specific error codes. This
  will not cause any runtime changes, but any code that uses `HH_FIXME[4110]`
  may need to be updated to avoid typechecker errors.
