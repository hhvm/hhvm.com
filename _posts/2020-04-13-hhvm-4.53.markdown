HHVM 4.53 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.47;
HHVM 4.48&ndash;4.52 remain supported, as do the 4.8 and 4.32 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- We now build binary packages for Ubuntu 19.10. Packages for Ubuntu 20.04
  should become available after its final release.
- The type-checker now provides more helpful error messages when cyclic shape
  type aliases are detected, pointing out both the invalid type alias and the
  cause of the cycle.

# Breaking Changes

- `?>` can no longer be used to terminate `//` comments (`?>` for all other
  purposes was removed in HHVM 4.52)
