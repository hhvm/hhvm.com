HHVM 4.111 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.105;
HHVM 4.106&ndash;4.110 remain supported, as do the 4.80 and 4.102 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- *Abstract*
  [context constants](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/contexts-and-capabilities/context-constants)
  are now allowed by default (in previous HHVM versions, they can be enabled
  using the INI option `enable_abstract_context_constants = true`).
- The typechecker no longer raises an error if the `?->` operator is used on an
  object of a non-nullable type (these calls are safe, even if unnecessary).

# Breaking Changes

- The typechecker now raises an error when the same non-abstract method is
  included in a class via multiple traits. These had already been runtime
  errors, but not always caught by the typechecker.
- The typechecker now detects more cases when a `Map` is used with a key of an
  invalid type (e.g. `dynamic`, `null`) that would previously only cause runtime
  errors.
- Fixed a bug where the typechecker wouldn't detect a constructor calling a
  method with an uninitialized instance variable:
  `$this->someMethod($this->uninitializedVar)`
