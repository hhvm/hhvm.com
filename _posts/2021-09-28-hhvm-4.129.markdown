HHVM 4.129 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.123; HHVM 4.124&ndash;4.128 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- `hackfmt --in-place` (or `-i`) no longer writes to files that do not have
  formatting changes.
- added `hackfmt --check-formatting` which, given a list of files, prints
  which files would be modified by `hackfmt --in-place`.
- `hackfmt` now correctly handles multi-line string literals.
- fixes `DateTimeZone::listIdentifiers()` returning an empty set.
- fixes the `UTC` timezone not being recognized.

# Breaking Changes

- `isset()` no longer permits `inout` arguments.
- Many built-in exceptions including `RuntimeException` and `LogicException`
  now extend the new `ExceptionWithPureGetMessage` class; all descendents that
  override `getMessage()` must mark it as pure, e.g. `getMessage()[]`.
