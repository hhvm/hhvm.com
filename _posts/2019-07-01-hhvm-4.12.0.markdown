HHVM 4.12 is released! This release marks the end of support for the 4.6.x
series.

# Highlights

- Abstract methods are now able to be overridden by other abstract methods.
- Improved error messages for inappropriate usage of the `async` keyword, e.g.
  abstract methods and interfaces.
- Methods with the same name as the class are no longer parsed as constructors.
- XBox tasks now execute `<<__EntryPoint>>` functions.
- Fixed assertion failure when building repo-authoritative bytecode repositories
  with HHVM built against libc++ instead of libstdc++ (e.g. MacOS).
- Autocomplete docblocks are now sent to IDEs as markdown.
- If using CLI server mode, PSP is now ran before exit.
- Fixed a segmentation fault when using vsdebug as a REPL.
- Improved response time when IDEs request docblocks.

# Breaking Changes

- `hh_client --retries` is now a synonym of `--timeout`
- The optional `&$output_headers` argument has been removed from
  `SoapClient::__soapcall`, as optional `inout` parameters are not supported.
