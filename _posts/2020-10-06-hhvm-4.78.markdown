HHVM 4.78 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.72;
HHVM 4.73&ndash;4.77 remain supported, as do the 4.32 and 4.56 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- The `(class|function|interface|trait)_exists` functions are now more optimized
  in repo-authoritative mode. This takes advantage of the fact that all HHBBC
  definitions are now unique and persistent.
- Improved the typechecker error for invalid `(string)` casts.
- `var_dump()` now distinguishes between `varray`s and `darray`s by default,
  instead of reporting both as `array`.

# Breaking Changes

- `is shape(...)` requires a `darray`, and `is tuple(...)` requires a `varray`;
  `is` checks with reified generics are now consistent with this when the
  generic is a shape or tuple. Previously, reified generics were more
  permissive.
- `require()` and related functions no longer support URIs,
  e.g. `file://foo.hack`.
- All special-casing for `array` has been removed from the parser. It is now
  parsed as a `name` token, like user-defined types.

# Future Changes

- calling `array_fill_keys()` will require that `$keys` is a
  `Container<Tk as arraykey>`; this will allow specifying a
  `darray<Tk, Tv>` return type. Currently, it will return `null` if `$keys`
  is not a `Container`.
