HHVM 4.163 is released! 4.160 - 4.162 remain supported,
as do the 4.128 and 4.153 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Added `HH\str_bitwise_xor` to perform bitwise xor operator on strings
- Relax restriction that prevents defaults and concrete type definitions with
  the same name in the same hierarchy. e.g. the following code now type checks:
  ``` hack
  interface I1 {
    const type T = int;
  }
  interface I2 {
    abstract const type T = float;
  }
  class C implements I1, I2 {}
  ```


# Breaking Changes

- Removed the support to instance methods in Expression Trees
