HHVM 4.41 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.34;
HHVM 4.35&ndash;4.40 remain supported, as do the 4.8 and 4.32 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- A new type alias, `HH\enumname<TEnum>`, represents the name of the enum type
  `TEnum` (similarly to `classname<TClass>`).
- A new function, `HH\type_structure_for_alias`, returns the `TypeStructure` of
  the specified type alias (similarly to `HH\type_structure` for type constants
  in classes).
  - Note that the `TypeStructure` API remains experimental and may be changed or
    removed in the future.
- Builtin functions `usort`, `uasort`, `uksort` now accept callbacks that return
  any `num` value (`int` or `float`), allowing for more convenient sorting of
  `float` arrays.
  - Note that these functions return
    [legacy arrays](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/built-in-types/arrays#php-arrays-array-varray-and-darray)
    which are deprecated. Prefer
    [`Vec\sort`](https://docs.hhvm.com/hsl/reference/function/HH.Lib.Vec.sort/),
    [`Dict\sort`](https://docs.hhvm.com/hsl/reference/function/HH.Lib.Dict.sort/),
    [`Keyset\sort`](https://docs.hhvm.com/hsl/reference/function/HH.Lib.Keyset.sort/).

# Breaking Changes

- Fixed a bug that allowed XHP children declarations to contain undefined types.
  This may reveal many previously ignored errors.
  - XHP children declarations can now only contain defined, non-aliased,
    non-generic Hack types, XHP category names (`%foo`), and the special values
    `pcdata`, `any` and `empty` (case-sensitive).
  - Note that only the children declaration is type-checked, not the actual
    children where the XHP element is used. A library such as
    [xhp-lib](https://github.com/hhvm/xhp-lib) must be used for that.
- Typechecker errors due to assigning a value of the wrong type to an
  [inout parameter](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/functions/inout-parameters) are
  now reported at the location where the inout parameter is declared. This may
  require some `HH_FIXME`s to be moved.
- The method `returnsReference` was removed from `ReflectionFunction` and
  `ReflectionMethod`. It always returned `false` since HHVM
  [no longer supports references](https://hhvm.com/blog/2019/10/01/deprecating-references.html).
