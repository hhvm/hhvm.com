HHVM 4.131 is released! HHVM 4.126&ndash;4.130 remain supported, as do the 4.102 and 4.128 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Breakpoints in Visual Studio Code no longer require the legacy debugger to be enabled.
- Added `AsyncMysqlConnectionPool::connectAndQuery()`.
- Fixed `ReflectionTypeConstant::getTypeStructure()` incorrectly referring to
  the declaring class for inherited type constants, instead of the current class.
  This could lead to bugs if the type constant referred to `this`.
- Fixed a memory leak in `Str\replace` functions introduced in 4.130
