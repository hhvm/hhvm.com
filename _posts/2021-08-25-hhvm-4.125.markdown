HHVM 4.124 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.118; HHVM 4.120&ndash;4.123 remain supported (4.119 was skipped), as do the 4.80 and 4.102 LTS releases.

This release primarily contains improvements to implementation details, and
preparatory work for future features/changes.

# Future Changes

- `Str\` HSL functions will start throwing `InvalidArgumentException` instead of
  `InvariantException` when invalid offsets or lengths are passed. We strongly
  recommend against catching either of these exceptions.
