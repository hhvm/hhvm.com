HHVM 4.60 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.54;
HHVM 4.55&ndash;4.58 remain supported, as does the 4.32 LTS release.

# Highlights

- Added `hh_parse --pretty-print-json`
- Improved error readability for recursive types.
- `Shapes::idx()` now permits `null` as the first argument, for consistency
  with `idx()`.

# Breaking Changes

- Fix typing bug that allowed calling invalid static methods on reified
  generics, e.g.
  `function test<reifiy T as arraykey>() : void { T::foo(); }`
- `Removed Exception::setPreviousChain()`; using this was already a type error
  as it was not in the HHI files.
