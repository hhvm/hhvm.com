HHVM 4.95 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.87;
HHVM 4.88&ndash;4.94 remain supported, as do the 4.56 and 4.80 LTS releases.

(Note: HHVM 4.89 and 4.90 were skipped.)

# Highlights

- Fixed an issue where overriding a type constant from a parent class/interface
  could cause a runtime error even if the code passed the typechecker
  ([example](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/206760e532d7f58084d9f32904d35b6735f57e66#diff-980a17de858c05e56fd438cc18277928d6403d191640f53d25c0302af056b22d)).
- Fixed various typechecker error messages incorrectly refering to a type
  constant as "property".
- The SOAP extension now supports proxy authentication (new options
  `proxy_ssl_cert_path`, `proxy_ssl_key_path`, `proxy_ssl_ca_bundle`).

# Breaking Changes

- The builtin function `debug_backtrace()` now returns arguments (the `'args'`
  key in the returned array) in a `vec` (previously `varray`).
- Return type annotations were added to various
  [`DateTime`](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/b31d8cc07fa084ce6a910128eeaae4e7edec36d1#diff-363445008aa8e1350233eb217353a35f808a91d29ba3fd382f24e2bb9244f80b)
  methods (matching what these methods already returned). This may reveal
  previously hidden typechecker errors.

# Future Changes

- Calling a function or method "dynamically" (e.g. calling a function/method
  whose name is stored in a variable) will become more restricted in the future.
  - See
    [previous announcement](https://hhvm.com/blog/2020/11/30/hhvm-4.86.html#future-changes)
    for more details.
  - This release adds a new builtin function
    `dynamic_meth_caller(string $cls_name, string $meth_name)`
    that should be used to call *instance* (non-static) methods dynamically.
