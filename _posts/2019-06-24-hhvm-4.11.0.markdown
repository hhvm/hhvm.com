HHVM 4.11 is released! This release marks the end of support for the 4.5.x
series.

# Highlights

- improved error locations for `inst_meth()`/`class_meth()` with
  private or protected methods.
- added an admin server endpoint to remove units from the unit cache; for
  example: `curl 'http://localhost:8003/invalidate-units?path=/my/file.php&path=/my/other/file.php'`
- type mismatch errors (4110) now report the full types
- PHP sort functions are now annotated as `inout` instead of by-reference in the
  HHIs; both `inout` and references continue to work at runtime.
- added `hh_client --extract-standalone`, to create self-contained files
  containing a function and all recursive dependencies.
- bytecode is no longer regenerated for source files that are touched but
  have an unchanged SHA.
- if, at runtime, a class uses multiple traits that declare the same method,
  the error message now includes the trait names.

# Breaking Changes

- the key generic for the `darray` type and the `HH\darray()` function
  (autoimported) is now required to be an `arraykey`.
- PHP7-style anonymous function `use()` clause positioning is now a parser
  error; Hack requires `use()` after the return type, while PHP7 has `use()`
  before the return type.
- `dict()`, `vec()`, and `keyset()` are now in the `HH\` namespace; they remain
  autoimported, so this change only breaks fully-qualified references.
