HHVM 4.113 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.107;
HHVM 4.108&ndash;4.112 remain supported, as do the 4.80 and 4.102 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Packages for Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo) are now available.
- A new
  [context](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/contexts-and-capabilities/available-contexts-and-capabilities)
  was added: `write_this_props`. This is similar to `write_props`, but only
  allows modifying properties of the current instance (`$this`). The associated
  capability is automatically available to all constructors, i.e. any
  constructor can call any method on `$this` that has the `write_this_props`
  context. This makes it possible to move some initialization code from
  constructors to helper methods, which was previously impossible for any class
  that was instantiated from any pure function (or any other function that
  didn't have the `write_props` context).

# Breaking Changes

- Fixed a bug where the typechecker would sometimes incorrectly infer the type
  of a value when dealing with `arraykey` and `num`-typed values. This may
  reveal some previously undetected errors.
- The INI option `hhvm.server.allow_duplicate_cookies` was removed.
