HHVM 4.113 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.107;
HHVM 4.108&ndash;4.112 remain supported, as do the 4.80 and 4.102 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- Packages for Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo) are now available.

# Breaking Changes

- Fixed a bug where the typechecker would sometimes incorrectly infer the type
  of a value when dealing with `arraykey` and `num`-typed values. This may
  reveal some previously undetected errors.
- The INI option `hhvm.server.allow_duplicate_cookies` was removed.
