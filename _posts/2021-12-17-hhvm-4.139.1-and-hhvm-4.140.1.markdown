HHVM 4.139.1 and HHVM 4.140.1 are released! These releases add support for a new
environment variable, `HHVM_DISABLE_PERSONALITY`, which disables use of the
`personality()` syscall on Linux.

Like `HHVM_DISABLE_NUMA`, this is required in some restricted environments, such
as Docker containers, and is now set in our Docker containers for these
versions.
