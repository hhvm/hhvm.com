HHVM 4.46 is released! This release marks the end of support for 4.40;
HHVM 4.41&ndash;4.45 remain supported, as do the 4.8 and 4.32 LTS releases.

# Highlights

- clearer error message for unsuitably different expression types in
  `case foo_expr:` vs `switch(bar_expr)` 
- removed typechecker error for 'exhaustive' enum switch statements with a
  `default` case; as enums are not enforced at runtime, these defaults are
  not strictly unreachable.
- added `HH\autoload_get_paths()`, returning a list of all files known to the
  autoloader.

# Future Changes

- Support for XHP `children` declarations will be removed; special syntax is no
  longer required to support this feature, and allows more easily making it
  compatible with the main XHP type system.
  - [xhp-lib v3.1](https://github.com/hhvm/xhp-lib/releases/tag/v3.1.0) provides
    the new implementation, via two traits:
    - `XHPChildDeclarationConsistencyValidation` requires that the new and old
      forms of child declaration are equivalent
    - `XHPChildValidation` requires that only a new declaration is present
  - [hhast-migrate v4.33.7](https://github.com/hhvm/hhast/releases/tag/v4.33.7)
    adds `--add-xhp-children-declaration-method` and
    `--remove-xhp-child-declarations`
- After support for XHP `children` declarations is completely removed, we expect
  to remove support for XHP `category` declarations: they are only used with
  children declarations, and by moving children declarations to standard Hack
  code, they can be replaced with normal interfaces.
